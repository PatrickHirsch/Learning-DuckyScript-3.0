### Exercise 2-1
The payload should open notepad on the target system (Windows 10), type "Hello, World!" and then blink the LED Green for 5 seconds
#### Work
* `ðŸªŸ`+`R` for Run
* Type 'notepad' then `ENTER`
* Wait for it to open.
* `STRING Hello, World!`
* Loop & use delays for timing?

* *Ducky was plugged into my personal laptop on campus at 5:02p EST to arm the payload onto it.*

The LED was observed to keep blinking well beyond 5 seconds... Eventually I stumbled into the solution to the issue being the need for spaces surrounding an `=` when changing a variable's value,

This was successful:
